\section{Introduction}
This tutorial is an introduction to verifying C code with VCC. Our
primary audience is programmers who want to write correct code and
verification engineers who want to check code for correctness. The
only prerequisite is a working understanding of C. 

To use VCC, you must first \emph{annotate} your code to specify how
your functions and data structures are meant to be used, and what your
functions guarantee to their callers. (VCC requires additional
annotations that we'll describe throughout the tutorial.) VCC then
takes your program and tries to \emph{prove} (mathematically) that
your program meets these specifications.  Unlike most program
analyzers, VCC doesn't look for bugs, or analyze an abstraction of
your program; if VCC certifies that your program is correct, then your
program really should be correct\footnote{In reality, this isn't
  really a guarantee, because VCC itself might have bugs. But in
  practice, this is unlikely to cause you to accidentally verify an
  incorrect program, unless you find and intentionally exploit such a
  bug. In addition, VCC currently doesn't do the checks needed to
  ignore processor store buffering; this will be remedied in the near
  future.}. 

To check your program, VCC generates a number of mathematical
statements (called \emph{verification conditions}) whose proofs
suffice to guarantee the program's correctness, and tries to prove
these statements using an automatic theorem prover. If any of these
proofs fail, VCC reflects these failures back to you in terms of the
program itself. For example, if your program contains uses division
somewhere, and VCC is unable to prove (from what thinks holds at the
point at which the division is done) that the divisor is nonzero, it
will report this to you as a program error at that point in the
program. (If you use VCC from within Visual Studio, it will show in
your program text the place where the error is, just like a syntax
error.) This doesn't mean that your program is necessarily incorrect;
most of the time, it is because your specifications aren't strong
enough to guarantee that the suspected error doesn't occur.
Typically, you fix this ``error'' by strengthening your
specifications. This might lead to other error reports, necessitating
the strengthening of other specifications, so verification is in
practive an iterative process. On occasion, this process reveals a
genuine programming error.

The important thing about this process is that you interact with VCC
entirely at the level of your program; you can safely ignore most of
the mathematical reasoning going on ``under the hood''.

Sometimes, annotating your program requires doing some extra
programming. For example, in a concurrent program where threads
acquire and release exclusive ownership of chunks of data, you will
often write small bits of \emph{ghost} code to manipulate the
ownership relation. (Ghost code is seen by VCC but not by the C
compiler, and so introduces no runtime overhead.) This is part of the
VCC philosophy -- 

This tutorial covers basics of VCC annotation language; by the time
you have finished working through it, you should be able to use VCC to
verify interesting programs. It doesn't cover the theoretical
background of VCC, implementation details, or advanced topics;
information on these can be found on the VCC homepage.

%%  These topics are covered
%% separately~\cite{lci}.  A high-level overview of the VCC tool chain is
%% also available separately~\cite{Cohen:TPHOLs2009-23}.

The following section covers the installation of VCC and 
After you're done you have two choices: one is to edit the tutorial examples
using Visual Studio and verify them using VCC Visual Studio addin.
Alternatively, you can invoke the VCC verifier directly from command line,
and use your favorite text editor to edit the examples.

\section{Installing VCC} 
You can use VCC either from the command line or from Visual Studio
2008 (VS).  We recommend the VS interface, but the command line interface
is sometimes useful for scripting.

If you are using VS, you should install it before
installing VCC\footnote{Does this matter now?}. You can use any
edition other than the express editions (which do not allow
plugins). If you neither own nor wish to buy VS, you can download a
free 6 month trial from the Microsoft web site.

After installing VS, install VCC\ from the installer link on the
VCC\ homepage. If you plan to build code verified with VCC (rather
than just verifying it), you will also want to put the VCC headers
into the VS\ include path, as follows: under the VS\ menu, 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose Tools$\rightarrow$Options
\item On the left hand side of the Options dialog box, click on the
  triangle next to Projects and Solutions, then click on the
  subheading marked ``VC++ Directories''
\item On the upper right hand corner of the dialog box, under the
  label ``Show directories for'' click on the drop-down box and select
  ``Include files''
\item Below the drop-down box, click on the second box from the left
  (the one with the folder icon, labelled ``New Line'').
\item To the right of the text entry box that opens, click on the box
  with labelled ``...''.
\item In the file chooser that opens up, navigate to the \verb!\\Headers!
  subdirectory of the VCC installation directory (e.g., \verb!C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Research\\Vcc\\Headers! is the default location for
  installations on 32-bit Windows) and click ``select folder''.
\item Close the options dialog box.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Running VCC}
\subsection{Running VCC from the command line}
The easiest way to call vcc on a set of files is
\todo{I've added some options that currently exist only as options to
  be passed to Boogie. We should not be exposing boogie to clients,
  so we should really have separate options to call the proof
  inspector and/or see error models (though I don't know which one we
  would display for multiple errors).}
\todo{More options}
\begin{verbatim}
vcc [/f:funs] [/Inspector] [/Models] files
\end{verbatim}
The \verb!/f! switch provides a comma-separate list of functions to
verify. The \verb!/Inspector! switch causes the VCC inspector to be
displayed while the verification is running, top monitor what VCC is
trying to do. The \verb!/Models! switch causes VCC to display models for
the errors that it finds.
 
\subsection{Running VCC from VS}
There are two ways to invoke VCC from within Visual
Studio\todo{Should we bother with the VCC menu also?}. First,
from the Verify tab at the top of the window, you can ask VCC verify
the current file. Second, if you right-click within a C source file,
several VCC commands are made available, depending on what kind of
construction intellisense thinks you are in the middle of. The choice
of verifying the entire file is always available. If you click within
the definition of a struct type, VCC will offer you the choice of
checking admissibility for that type (a concept explained in
section \ref{}). If you click within the body of a function, VCC should offer
you the opportunity to verify just that function. However,
intellisense often gets confused about the syntactic structure of
VCC code, so it may not give these context-dependent
options. However, if you select the name of a function and then right
click, it will allow you to verify just that function.

If you want to run the VCC inspector during verification, this
option can be selected from the \verb!Verify->settings! menu. If you want
to look at the error model for a particular error, right-click on
error (in the source), and choose ``Show VCC error model''\todo{This
  should really say ``VCC error model'', to not expose z3.}
