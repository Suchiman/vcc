\section{Preface a.k.a. ``You don't have to read this''}

This document serves as an introduction to verifying programs with VCC.
The theoretical background, including soundness arguments, is mostly
not covered here.
It is covered in a separate publication~\cite{lci}.
An high-level overview of the VCC tool chain is also covered separately~\cite{Cohen:TPHOLs2009-23}.
