\section{Assert and Assume}
\itodo{Penny: This section dives right into the meat. First, you need two things: 
1. A general guide to annotation syntax
2. A section that describes how to think in VCC terms is, you have to describe not only exactly what your code does at each step of the way, but what your program *doesnt* do. This latter point will nail people on loop verification every time. 
After you do the how to think part, I suggest some simple exercises, if this is in fact to be a tutorial. The whole book can come later. 
}
\itodo{Michal: I'm not sure about 1., 2. might be good idea.}
Let's begin with a simple example:

\vccInputSC{c/01_minInline2.c}
This program (internally) sets \vcc{z} to the minimum of \vcc{x} and
\vcc{y}. An annotation of the form \vcc{_( assert E )} says that whenever
control reaches the annotation, the asserted expression should hold (i.e.,
evaluate to something other than 0), so the line 
\vcc{_( assert z <= x && z <= y )} says that when control reaches the
assertion, \vcc{z} is no larger than \vcc{x} or \vcc{y}. Go ahead and
verify this function in VCC. 

VCC verifies this function succesfully which means that this assertion
is indeed correct (and that, in addition, the program cannot
crash). If VCC is unable to prove such an assertion, it reports an
error. Try changing the assertion in this program to something that
isn't true and see what happens.

Assertions, like all VCC annotations, 
are surrounded by \vcc{_( ... )} to indicate that they are
only for VCC, and are not part of the program being verified\footnote{
  The \vcc{<assert.h>} header file defines an \vcc{assert(E)} macro
  with similar meaning, but a different implementation: 
  \vcc{E} is evaluated at runtime (in checked builds) and
  the program terminated if \vcc{E} is false.  The two fundamental
  differences between these runtime assertions and VCC assertions are
  (1) VCC assertions allow expressions that use additional constructs
  (like quantification) that might not be executable, and (2) VCC
  assertions are checked for \emph{all} possible program executions.}.  
For the regular C compiler the \vcc{<vcc.h>} header file defines
\begin{VCC}
#define _(...) /* nothing */
\end{VCC}
VCC does not use this definition, and instead parses the inside of \vcc{_( ... )}
annotations.%
\footnote{
  One can prevent definition of \vcc{_}, and instead surround annotations with
  \vcc{__vcc_spec(...)}.
  This is controlled with \vcc{_VCC_DONT_USE_UNDERSCORE} macro-definition.}

To understand how VCC works, and to use if succesfully, it is useful to
think in terms of what VCC ``knows'' at various program points. In
this example, VCC initially knows nothing about the variables (they
can initially hold any value). Just before the first assignment, VCC knows that 
\vcc{x  <= y} (because execution followed that branch of the conditional), and
after the assignment, VCC knows additionally that \vcc{z} is equal to
\vcc{x}, so it knows that \vcc{z <= x && z <= y}. Similar reasoning
(with \vcc{x} and \vcc{y} reversed) hold in \vcc{else} branch, so VCC
knows that the assertion holds when control reaches it. In general,
VCC doesn't lose any information when reasoning about assignments and
conditionals. We will see in subsequent sections, however, that VCC
can lose information when reasoning about loops and function calls.

When VCC surprises you by failing to verify something that you think
it should be able to verify, it is usually because it doesn't know
something you thought it should. An assertion provides a simple way to
check whether VCC knows what you think it should know.

You can add to what VCC knows at a particular point by adding an
\emph{assumption}. An assumption \vcc{_( assume E )} effectively stops
the program from executing further if \vcc{E} doesn't
hold. Equivalently, you can think of it as telling VCC to just ignore
such executions. Operationally, it simply adds \vcc{E} to what VCC
knows, for subsequent reasoning. For example
\begin{VCC}
  int x,y;
  _( assume x != 0 )
  y = 1 / x;
\end{VCC}

Without the assumption, VCC would complain about possible division by
zero (it checks for division by zero because it would cause the
program to crash).  With the assumption, this error cannot happen.
Succesful verification with VCC only guarantees absence of errors for
those executions in which no assumption is is violated. Thus, you
normally want to verify your program without any assumptions.

If assumptions are to be avoided, why are assumptions useful at
all? They are useful in several ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item If a verification is not yet complete, assumptions can be used
  to mark the knowledge that VCC is missing, and guide further work.
  If you maintain the discipline of checking in your work only when
  everything verifies (but perhaps with assumptions), other people can
  read your annotated text and see how far away from complete your
  verification is, without having to look at the verification output
  itself.
\item When debugging a failed verification, you can use assumptions to
  narrow down the failed verification to a more specific failure
  scenario.
\item Sometimes you want to assume something even though VCC can
  verify it, just to stop VCC from spending time proving it. For
  example, assuming \vcc{0} (i.e., \vcc{\false}) allows VCC to prove
  all subsequent assertions, effectively focussing its attention on
  other parts of the program.
\item Sometimes you will want to make assumptions about the operating
  environment of a program. For example, you might want to assume that
  a 64-bit counter doesn't overflow, but don't want to justify it
  formally because it depends on extra-logical assumptions (like the
  speed of the hardware and the lifetime of the software). 
\item Finally, assumptions provide a useful tool in explaining how VCC
  reasons about your program. We'll see examples of this throughout
  this tutorial.
\end{itemize}

%%  What is however much more common is
%% use of assumption when debugging your specifications: when the program
%% does not verify you might try to temporarily add assumptions in a bet
%% ``if VCC knew that, would it verify my program?''.  Once you find what
%% is that thing VCC doesn't know, but what makes it verify the program,
%% you can figure out how to specify rest of your program, so that is
%% knows it.

% The following is a bad example, since we would normally specify
% hardware by an invariant on a volatile field.
%% One case is interaction with hardware: you might know the hardware is
%% going to leave specific I/O register positive, and an assumption is a
%% way to communicate that to VCC. 

An assertion can also change what VCC knows after the assertion, if
the assertion fails; even though VCC will report the failure as an error,
it will assume the asserted fact holds afterward. For example
\begin{VCC}
int x;
_( assert x == 0 ) // fails
_( assert x == 0 ) // succeeds
\end{VCC}

When we talk about what VCC knows, we mean what it knows in an ideal
sense, where if it knows \vcc{p}, it also knows any logical
consequence of \vcc{p}. In such a world, adding an assertion that
succeeds would have no effect on whether later assertions succeed.
VCC's ability to deduce consequences is indeed complete for many types
of expressions (e.g. expressions that use only equalities,
inequalities, addition, subtraction, multiplication by constants, and
logical operators), but not for all expressions, and VCC will
sometimes fail to prove an assertion, even though it ``knows'' enough
to prove it.  

Because VCC's reasoning is incomplete\footnote{Note that this
  incompleteness in no way makes VCC \emph{unsound}; it can cause
  false failure reports, but cannot cause VCC to verify a program that
  is not correct.}, an assertion that succeeds can sometimes cause
later assertions to succeed, by drawing VCC's attention to a crucial
lemma it needs to prove the later assertion.  This is relatively rare,
and typically involves ``nonlinear arithmetic'' (e.g. where variables
are multiplied together), bitvevtor reasoning, or quantifiers. We'll
say more about these in section \ref{}.

\subsection{Exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
In the following program fragment, which assertions will fail?
\begin{VCC}
int x,y; 
_( assert x > 5 ) 
_( assert x > 3 ) 
_( assert x < 2 ) 
_( assert y < 3 )
\end{VCC}
\item
Is there any difference between 
\begin{VCC}
_( assume p ) _( assume q  )
\end{VCC}
and 
\begin{VCC}
_( assume q ) _( assume p )
\end{VCC}
? What about if the assumptions are replaced by assertions?
\end{enumerate}
\section{Function specifications}

Now we turn to the specification of functions. We'll take the example
from the previous section, and pull the computation of the miminum of
two numbers out into a separate function:\todo{match with the previous programs}

\vccInput{c/01_min2.c}

(The listing above presents both the source code and the output
of VCC, typeset in a different font and color, and 
the actual file name of the example is replaced with \vcc{/*`testcase`*/}.)
VCC failed to prove our assertion, even though it's easy to see that
it always holds. This is because the verification is modular: VCC
doesn't look inside the body of \vcc{min()} when verifying \vcc{main()}.%
\footnote{
  If VCC did look into \vcc{min()} when verifying \vcc{main()}
  then in general we would quickly run into scalability problems.
  We will see later how to perform such inlining during verification.
}
Or to put it differently, VCC doesn't know anything about what the
\vcc{min()} function does, unless you specify it explicitly\footnote{
  Actually, VCC does know one important thing from this specification
  of \vcc{min()}: it knows that a call do \vcc{min()} has no side
  effects that are visible to the caller. We'll see in section ?? that
  any such side effects have to be explicitly specified.
}.
Since the correctness of \vcc{main()} clearly depends on what \vcc{min()}
does, we need to specify \vcc{min()} in order to verify \vcc{main()}.

The specification of a function is sometimes called a \emph{contract},
because it specifies obligations on both the function and its caller:
\begin{itemize}
\item The requirement on the caller (sometimes called the
  \emph{precondition} of the function) take the form 
  \vcc{_( requires E )}, 
  where \vcc{E} is an expression\footnote{\vcc{E} can mention
  only names that are in scope at the function entry, so it can
  mention parameters of the function and global variables and
  types.}.  In verifying the function, VCC implicitly assumes
  \vcc{E} on function entry, and for each call to the function, VCC
  implicitly asserts \vcc{E} (after the function arguments have been
  evaluated and bound to the parameter names).

\item The requirement on the function (sometimes called the
  \emph{postcondition} of the function) takes the form
  \vcc{_( ensures E )}, where \vcc{E} is an expression; this says that
  the function promises that \vcc{E} holds when control is returned to
  the caller.  In the code of the caller, VCC implicitly assumes \vcc{E}
  just after the call returns (but
  before the result is used). In the code of the function, at each return
  point of the function (including, implicitly,
  at the end of the function body), VCC asserts that the postcondition
  of the function holds (with the vcc keyword \vcc{\result} bound to the
  return value, and the function parameters 
  interpreted according to the values they had on function entry).
\end{itemize}

For example, we can provide a suitable specification for \vcc{min} as
follows: 
\vccInput[linerange={min-endmin,out-}]{c/01_min3.c}
\noindent
The precondition \vcc{_( requires \true )} of \vcc{min()} really doesn't say
anything (since \vcc{\true} holds in every state), and is included
only to emphasize that the function can be called from any state and
with arbitrary input values.
The postcondition states that the value returned from \vcc{Min()} 
is no bigger than either of the inputs.
Note that \vcc{\true} and \vcc{\result} are spelled with a backslash.
All VCC keywords, which can be used in expressions, start with a backslash.
This does not apply to the first keyword after \vcc{_}, because it cannot
be confused with a C identifier (thus you are still free to have, \eg
a function called \texttt{requires} or \texttt{assert}).

As described above, VCC translates the program roughly as follows:
\vccInput{c/01_min_assert.c}

As for call itself, because the \vcc{min()} function above has no
visible specification, VCC doesn't know anything about the value it
might possibly return.  Therefore, as far as VCC's understanding is
concerned, the line:
\begin{VCC}
position = min(newPos, LIMIT);
\end{VCC}
\noindent
could be replaced with:
\begin{VCC}
position = anything();
\end{VCC}
\noindent
that is assigning an unspecified value to the variable \vcc{position}.
The only knowledge about it comes from the following assumption.

\todo{put this into an exercise}
One way to illustrate that the verification of \vcc{main()} 
depends only on the specification of \vcc{min()} is to 
replace \vcc{<} with \vcc{>} in the return statement of \vcc{min()}.
The output of verification shows that \vcc{main()} is still correct -
only \vcc{min()} is broken:
\vccInput[linerange={out-}]{c/01_min4.c}

\todo{put this into an exercise also}
Let's also consider the meaning of \vcc{_( requires \false )}.
When verifying function body it translates to an assumption.
As we have noted this will make the body of function verify,
regardless what it contains.
On the other hand, you will be unable to verify call to such a function
from outside.
Conversely, \vcc{_( ensures \false )} will prevent verification
of the body of the function, but will make the function that calls
it verify.

As we can see, in each case there is something that does not verify.
However, because of this one should be careful when interpreting
VCC answers: successful verification of a function is only meaningful
if everything it calls was verified.

\subsection{Fancy example}
\todo{put this somewhere later in a section about bit vectors}
Finally, 
to show something little less trivial, the implementation of \vcc{min()} can surprisingly be more involved.
For example the one below does not use a branch.

\vccInput[]{c/01_min5.c}

\noindent
The syntax:
\begin{VCC}
_( assert {bv} \forall int x; (x & -1) == x )
\end{VCC}

\noindent
VCC to prove the assertion using the fixed-length bit vector theory, a.k.a. machine integers.
This is then used as a lemma to prove the postcondition.


\subsection{Write Clauses and old(...)}
So far, we have considered only functions without side effects; for
example, we assumed that the call to \vcc{min()} didn't have the side
effect of changing the local variables of \vcc{main()}. The
translation above captured this requirement implicitly, by allowing a
\vcc{main()} to call \vcc{min()} without losing any of its prior
knowledge. VCC requires that any side effects of a function that might
be visible to the caller (in the sense of destroying knowledge that
the caller might have) must be explicitly declared in the
specification of the function. Side effects to state that the caller
cannot possibly know about (e.g., local variables of the function
body) do not have to be reported. (We will see in section \ref{} that
VCC only allows the caller to know very specific things, which allows
the function to do other things with global side effects without
having to report them.)

In VCC, you declare that a function might have a visible side effect
my means of a \emph{writes clause}. 
Intuitively, a clause \vcc{_( writes p, q )} is equivalent to saying
that the function is going to modify \emph{only} objects pointed to by \vcc{p}
and objects pointed to by \vcc{q}.
In other words, it is the same as having an ensures clause
saying that everything the caller might know about, other than the objects
pointed to by \vcc{*p} and \vcc{*q}, stays unchanged. VCC allows you
to specify pointers in separate writes clauses, and implicitly
combines them into a single set. If a function spec contains no writes clauses, 
it is equivalent to specifying a writes clause with empty set of pointers.

Here is a simple example of a function that has visible side effects:
\vccInput[linerange={swap-partition}]{c/04_partition.c}

\noindent
The expression \vcc{\old(*p)}, when used in a postcondition of a function,
returns the value of expression \vcc{*p}
as it was at just before the function was called. 

Now, let's have a look at a function calling \vcc{swap()}.

\vccInput[linerange={foo-}]{c/01_swap1.c}

Note that writes clauses list pointers to memory locations, not l-values
(\ie \vcc{_(writes &x, &y, &z)} and not \vcc{_(writes x, y, z)}).
Note also that because \vcc{z} aliases neither \vcc{x} not \vcc{y}, VCC can
knows that \vcc{swap(&x, &y)} does not change \vcc{z}.

Had we left out the writes clause from the specification of
\vcc{swap()}, VCC would report an error:

\vccInput[linerange={out-}]{c/01_swap2.c}

\noindent
\todo{change thread-locality to something better}
The complaints about thread-locality refer to the places where the function
reads \vcc{*p} and \vcc{*q}. Reading memory doesn't necessarily require
a writes clause (since it can't destroy knowledge of the caller),
but that doesn't necessarily make it safe; for example, the pointer might point
to memory that has been freed, or to memory that is lock-protected or owned
by another thread. For these (and other) reasons VCC implicitly
asserts \vcc{\thread_local(p)} just before any read access to \vcc{*p};
this predicate means that that the pointer points to an object that
``belongs'' to the current thread (much more about this later).

Similarly, just before write access to \vcc{*p}, VCC inserts the
assertion \vcc{\writable(p)}, which means that \vcc{\thread_local(p)},
that \vcc{*p} is in the ``phase of life'' where it can be modified,
that it \vcc{p} is in the current ``writes set''. (You can think of
the writes set as being the set of objects named in the writes clause,
along with those objects that the thread has gotten control of since
entry of the function; we will see how this can happen in section ??.)
For example, the assert/assume translation of \vcc{swap()} is:

\vccInput[linerange={swap-}]{c/01_swap3.c}

\noindent
Because the clause \vcc{writes p, q} essentially gives rise to a precondition
\vcc{requires \writable(p) && \writable(q)}, at a call  \vcc{swap(p, q)},
VCC also inserts \vcc{assert \writable(p) && \writable(q)}.
In particular if we forget to list \vcc{&x} in the writes
clause of \vcc{foo()} we will get:

\vccInput[linerange={out-}]{c/01_swap4.c}

%% One might wonder why cannot we just have 
%% \vcc{requires \writable(p)} and instead have the specialized writes clause.
%% The reason is that the writes clause also specifies that nothing
%% outside of the writes clause will be changed.
%% This is why we can prove that \vcc{y} is still \vcc{42} after the call
%% to \vcc{boundedIncr(&x)}. 


%A predicate \vcc{\mutable(p)} states that the object pointed to by \vcc{p}
%is allocated, ``belongs'' to the current thread, and is in a ``phase of life''
%that allows for modification.
%We will get into details all of these later.
%For now we just need to know that in order to be able to write to \vcc{*p}
%one needs to know that \vcc{p} was listed in the writes clause \emph{and} \vcc{\mutable(p)}.
%For example, if we remove the \vcc{_( writes ... )} clause from the
%\vcc{boundedIncr()} we get the following output:
